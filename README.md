## Minecraft plugin that sends Discord Webhooks from your server!
It's designed to work with [LumenMC](https://builtbybit.com/resources/lumenmc.52562/), but it works fine even without it. 
Basic and advanced configuration is available through ```config.yml```. 
It sends everything from server startup, player chats, commands to death messages. 
It even notifies you when the server stops ticking!

> ⚠️ Warning
><br>The plugin is in an alpha stage of development. You may experience bugs.
